# SpaceInvadersApp

This is a game, which I made in the 3rd semester of college. The game is based on a classic: the original SpaceInvaders game.

Once you start the game, you'll find the main menu, which looks like this:

With pressing the Start button, you get to start the gameplay. In the game you are able to move with "AD", with pressing "A" you get to move to the left, with pressing "D" you can move to the right. Once pressing "ESCAPE" you will be sent back to the main menu, with pressing "R" you can restart the game before dying, and with pressing "SPACE" you can shoot.


The gameplay itself looks so:

You can also upgrade your player on the Uprade scene, which is available from the Main Menu, you have a possibility to unlock "double-shooting" or buy more health for yourself.

The game also features saving, which includes saving your latest upgrades and loading them, when next playing the game.
